# Chess Game in C# (Console Application)

This project is a console-based Chess game developed in C# as part of the **C# COMPLETE Object-Oriented Programming** course by Professor NÃ©lio Alves on **Udemy**. The goal of the project is to create a fully functional chess game using object-oriented programming principles, with a focus on structure, design, and implementation of core game logic.

## Features

- **Full Chessboard Representation:** The game features a standard 8x8 chessboard where players can make their moves.
- **Player vs Player Mode:** Two players can play against each other on the same machine, with moves being entered via the console.
- **Chess Piece Movement:** The game enforces all standard chess rules for piece movement, including special moves like castling and en passant.
- **Turn-based Gameplay:** Players take turns making moves until the game ends with checkmate, stalemate, or draw.

## Technologies Used

- **C# (C Sharp):** The game is built using C#, a powerful object-oriented programming language.
- **Console Application:** The user interface is entirely text-based, running in the console.
